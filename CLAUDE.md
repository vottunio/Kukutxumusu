This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a cross-chain NFT marketplace project for Kukuxumusu, a Spanish design brand. The project involves creating a Web3 platform with auction and direct purchase capabilities using a cross-chain architecture.

**Key Features:**
- Cross-chain architecture: Payments on Base, NFTs on Story Protocol
- Multi-token payment system (VTN, ETH, USDT)
- Auction system with multiple simultaneous auctions
- Multi-wallet integration (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- IPFS-based decentralized storage via Pinata
- Administrative dashboard for NFT uploads
- Public transparency dashboard showing sales and treasury balance
- Explore/gallery page with filtering capabilities
- Automated cross-chain relayer service

## Tech Stack

### Blockchain
- **Payment Network**: Base (handles payments and auctions)
- **NFT Network**: Story Protocol (handles NFT minting and ownership)
- **Payment Tokens**: VTN, ETH (native), USDT (ERC-20) - all on Base
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
  - Payment Contract (Base): Multi-token payments and auction system
  - NFT Contract (Story): ERC-721 with access-controlled minting
- **Storage**: IPFS + Pinata for images and metadata

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Web3 Integration**: wagmi + viem for multi-chain wallet connections
- **Hosting**: AWS EC2 with Docker containerization

### Backend/Relayer
- **Language**: Go
- **Libraries**: go-ethereum (Geth) for blockchain interactions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or SQLite for transaction queue and cross-chain tracking
- **Concurrency**: Goroutines for simultaneous event listening
- **API**: REST endpoints for status and monitoring
- **Purpose**: Listens to payment events on Base and executes mints on Story

### Infrastructure
- **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose (3 services: frontend, backend, relayer)
- **CI/CD**: Automated pipeline for container builds and deployments
- **Domain**: Route 53 for DNS management
- **SSL/TLS**: Managed certificates
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch for relayer monitoring and alerts

## Project Architecture

### Cross-Chain Design
The project uses a **two-contract cross-chain architecture**:

**Payment Contract (Base):**
- Handles all payments in VTN, ETH (native), or USDT (ERC-20)
- Multiple simultaneous time-limited auctions
- Bid tracking with token information
- Winner determination
- Treasury management with multisig wallet
- Emits events: `PaymentReceived`, `DirectPurchase`, `AuctionCreated`, `BidPlaced`, `AuctionWon`

**NFT Contract (Story Protocol):**
- ERC-721 standard NFT minting
- Access-controlled minting (only authorized relayer can mint)
- Batch minting capability
- Automatic transfer to buyer
- Royalty configuration for secondary sales
- Emits events: `NFTMinted`, `BatchMinted`

**Backend/Relayer Service (Go):**
- Written in Go using go-ethereum (Geth)
- Listens to payment events on Base using goroutines
- Automatically executes mints on Story Protocol when payment is confirmed
- Queue system for pending transactions (PostgreSQL/SQLite)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for failed mints
- Idempotency to prevent duplicate mints
- Cross-chain transaction tracking
- REST API for status queries
- Health check endpoints
- Structured logging (logrus/zap)
- Optional Prometheus metrics
- Monitoring dashboard for admins

### Frontend Application Structure
Single Page Application inspired by nouns.wtf design:

**1. Home (Landing + Active Auction)**
- Hero section with main active auction highlighted
- Live countdown timer
- Direct bidding form with token selector (VTN/ETH/USDT)
- Real-time bidder list with token information
- Brief project information (sticky sidebar or bottom section)
- Recently minted NFTs showcase
- Cross-chain transaction tracking component

**2. Explore**
- Complete gallery of all minted NFTs (data from Story Protocol)
- Filters by attributes/traits
- Search by token ID or owner
- Responsive grid layout
- Shows cross-chain info (payment on Base + NFT on Story)

**3. Public Dashboard**
- Sales statistics from Base
- Treasury balance display (VTN, ETH, USDT)
- Cross-chain transaction history
- Transparency metrics

**4. Admin Dashboard (Protected)**
- Wallet-based authentication
- NFT upload interface with IPFS integration
- Auction management
- Relayer monitoring and status
- Cross-chain transaction queue visibility

### Economic & Transparency Model
- All payments flow to treasury multisig wallet on Base (VTN, ETH, USDT)
- Public dashboard displays real-time sales and treasury balance from Base
- Verified smart contract codes on both block explorers (Base + Story)
- Only authorized Kukuxumusu wallet can withdraw funds from Base treasury
- Only authorized relayer can mint NFTs on Story
- 5-10% royalties on secondary market sales
- Complete transaction history on-chain (payments on Base, mints on Story)

## Development Approach

### MVP Philosophy (1 Week)
This is a rapid MVP with focus on core functionality:
- Minimize scope to validate market before full investment
- Cross-chain architecture (Base for payments, Story for NFTs)
- Multi-token payment support (VTN, ETH, USDT)
- Automated relayer service for cross-chain operations
- No DAO features in MVP (Phase 2)
- Basic admin panel (advanced features in Phase 2)
- No external marketplace integration in MVP
- No full smart contract audit (basic review only)
- Basic monitoring of relayer (full alerting in Phase 2)

### Deployment & Operations
- Containerized deployment using Docker on AWS EC2
- Three services: Frontend, Backend API, Relayer
- Auto-scaling capability with multiple EC2 instances
- Automated backups for relayer database
- CloudWatch for monitoring relayer operations
- Alerts for cross-chain transaction failures
- CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
