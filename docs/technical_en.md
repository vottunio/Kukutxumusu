### MVP Limitations
- No DAO functionalities (planned for Phase 2)
- Administrative panel with basic functions
- No integration with external marketplaces
- No complete smart contract audit (basic review only)
- Explore with basic filters (advanced version in Phase 2)
- No advanced data analysis tools
- Basic monitoring (no complete alert system)

### Economic Management and Transparency
- **Treasury Wallet (Base)**: Implementation of dedicated multisig wallet on Base to receive all sales funds in VTN, ETH and USDT
- **Public Dashboard**: Public page showing real-time number of NFTs sold and treasury balance on Base
- **Verified Smart Contracts**: Code of both contracts (Base and Story) verified on their respective block explorers
- **Withdraw function**: Only Kukuxumusu's authorized wallet can withdraw accumulated funds on Base
- **Royalties**: Configuration of 5-10% royalties on secondary sales automatically sent to treasury
- **Cross-Chain Transparency**: All payment events on Base are linked with minted NFTs on Story

### Application Architecture

#### Frontend (Single Page Application)
- **Technology**: Next.js + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Structure**: Single web application with multiple pages/sections
- **Design inspired by**: nouns.wtf
- **Main pages**:
  - **Home (Landing + Active Auction)**: Hero with featured main auction, time counter, direct bid form with token selector (VTN/ETH/USDT), real-time bidder listing, brief project information, latest minted NFTs
  - **Explore**: Complete gallery of all minted NFTs with filters, search and responsive grid
  - **Public Dashboard**: Sales statistics, treasury balance on Base, cross-chain transaction history
  - **Admin Dashboard**: Protected panel for NFT upload, auction management and relayer monitoring (access restricted by wallet)

#### Backend - Cross-Chain Architecture

**Payment Smart Contract (Base)**
- Multi-token payment management (VTN, ETH, USDT)
- System of multiple simultaneous auctions with time limit
- Bidder registration and winner determination
- Multisig treasury for fund custody
- On-chain events: `PaymentReceived`, `AuctionCreated`, `BidPlaced`, `AuctionWon`
- Each bid will be registered as an on-chain event to guarantee total transparency and verifiability
- `BidPlaced` events will contain all bid information (bidder, amount, timestamp, tokenId)

**NFT Smart Contract (Story Protocol)**
- ERC-721 NFT minting with IPFS metadata
- Access control: only authorized backend/relayer can mint
- Automatic transfer function to auction winner
- Configured royalties for secondary sales

**Backend/Relayer Service (Go) - Critical Cross-Chain Operations**
- **Purpose**: Autonomous service for cross-chain transaction execution (Base → Story)
- **Language**: Go using go-ethereum (Geth) - chosen for performance and native blockchain support
- **Deployment**: Standalone service running 24/7 on AWS EC2 (separate from Next.js)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Listens for payment events on Base (`PaymentReceived`, `AuctionWon`) using WebSocket/HTTP polling
  - Executes automatic NFT mint transactions on Story Protocol when payment confirmed
  - Transfers minted NFTs to buyer/winner addresses
  - Maintains persistent cross-chain transaction queue with PostgreSQL/SQLite
  - Implements retry logic with exponential backoff for failed mints
  - Provides REST API for monitoring relayer status and pending transactions
- **Why Go?**: High performance, excellent concurrency (goroutines), native blockchain libraries, runs as system service

**Next.js API Routes - Frontend/User-Facing Data**
- **Purpose**: Serve data to the React frontend for user interface
- **Language**: TypeScript (Next.js App Router API routes)
- **Deployment**: Integrated with Next.js frontend on AWS EC2
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Query and aggregate data from Base and Story Protocol for display
  - Cache NFT metadata from IPFS to reduce load times
  - Provide endpoints for gallery/explore page (NFT listings with filters)
  - Aggregate auction data and bidder lists from Base
  - Cross-chain data correlation (match payments on Base with NFTs on Story)
  - Optional: Proxy requests to Go relayer for status updates
- **Why Next.js?**: Direct integration with frontend, serverless functions, easy caching, TypeScript type safety

**Key Difference**:
- **Go Relayer = Write Operations** (execute blockchain transactions automatically)
- **Next.js API = Read Operations** (serve data to users, no transaction execution)

```
**Storage**:
  - IPFS/Pinata: Images and NFT metadata
    - Original images: 2000x2000px (1:1), PNG/JPG format, max 10MB, with optional transparency
    - Automatically generated optimized versions:
      - Thumbnail (gallery): 400x400px
      - Media (cards): 800x800px
      - Full (detail view): 2000x2000px original
    - Metadata: ERC-721 JSON standard with attributes/traits
- Database: Auxiliary information, cache and cross-chain tracking


Flujo correcto:
Fase 1: Admin prepara (ANTES de la subasta)
Admin Panel:
├── Sube SOLO la imagen a Pinata → ipfs://QmImageHash
└── Guarda este hash asociado al NFT ID
Fase 2: Subasta ocurre
Base Contract:
├── createAuction(nftId: 5, duration, tokens...)
├── Usuarios hacen bids (se guardan on-chain como eventos)
└── Auction termina → ganador definido
Fase 3: Backend genera metadata completo (DESPUÉS)
Backend/Relayer:
├── Detecta AuctionWon
├── Lee todos los bids del contrato
├── Crea metadata JSON completo:
   {
     "name": "Kukuxumusu #5",
     "image": "ipfs://QmImageHash", ← de Fase 1
     "description": "...",
     "attributes": [...],
     "auction_history": [todos los bids] ← de blockchain
   }
├── Sube este JSON a Pinata → ipfs://QmMetadataHash
└── Mintea NFT con esta URI completa
Entonces necesitas:
Admin panel: Solo sube imagen + datos básicos → guarda relación nftId → imageHash
Backend/Relayer: Genera metadata completo + sube a Pinata + mintea
¿Modifico el UploadNFTForm para que solo suba la imagen y datos básicos (sin generar metadata final)


#### Deployment

- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose for consistent environments
- **CI/CD**: Automated pipeline for container build and deploy
- **Payment Smart Contract**: Deployed and verified on Base mainnet
- **NFT Smart Contract**: Deployed and verified on Story Protocol mainnet
- **Relayer Service**: Persistent service with automatic retries to guarantee mints
- **Domain**: Custom domain configuration with SSL/TLS
- **Scalability**: Possibility to scale horizontally with multiple EC2 instances
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch for cross-chain event tracking and alerts
