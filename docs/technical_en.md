### Application Architecture

#### Frontend (Single Page Application)
- **Technology**: Next.js + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Structure**: Single web application with multiple pages/sections
- **Design inspired by**: nouns.wtf
- **Main pages**:
  - **Home (Landing + Active Auction)**: Hero with featured main auction, time counter, direct bid form with token selector (VTN/ETH/USDT), real-time bidder listing, brief project information, latest minted NFTs
  - **Explore**: Complete gallery of all minted NFTs with filters, search and responsive grid
  - **Public Dashboard**: Sales statistics, treasury balance on Base, cross-chain transaction history
  - **Admin Dashboard**: Protected panel for NFT upload, auction management and relayer monitoring (access restricted by wallet)

#### Backend - Cross-Chain Architecture

**Payment Smart Contract (Base)**
- Multi-token payment management (VTN, ETH, USDT)
- System of multiple simultaneous auctions with time limit
- Bidder registration and winner determination
- Multisig treasury for fund custody
- On-chain events: `PaymentReceived`, `AuctionCreated`, `BidPlaced`, `AuctionWon`
- Each bid will be registered as an on-chain event to guarantee total transparency and verifiability
- `BidPlaced` events will contain all bid information (bidder, amount, timestamp, tokenId)

**NFT Smart Contract (Story Protocol)**
- ERC-721 NFT minting with IPFS metadata
- Access control: only authorized backend/relayer can mint
- Automatic transfer function to auction winner
- Configured royalties for secondary sales

**Backend/Relayer Service (Go) - Critical Cross-Chain Operations**
- **Purpose**: Autonomous service for cross-chain transaction execution (Base → Story)
- **Language**: Go using go-ethereum (Geth) - chosen for performance and native blockchain support
- **Deployment**: Standalone service running 24/7 on AWS EC2 (separate from Next.js)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Listens for payment events on Base (`PaymentReceived`, `AuctionWon`) using WebSocket/HTTP polling
  - Executes automatic NFT mint transactions on Story Protocol when payment confirmed
  - Transfers minted NFTs to buyer/winner addresses
  - Maintains persistent cross-chain transaction queue with PostgreSQL/SQLite
  - Implements retry logic with exponential backoff for failed mints
  - Provides REST API for monitoring relayer status and pending transactions
- **Why Go?**: High performance, excellent concurrency (goroutines), native blockchain libraries, runs as system service

**Next.js API Routes - Frontend/User-Facing Data**
- **Purpose**: Serve data to the React frontend for user interface
- **Language**: TypeScript (Next.js App Router API routes)
- **Deployment**: Integrated with Next.js frontend on AWS EC2
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Query and aggregate data from Base and Story Protocol for display
  - Cache NFT metadata from IPFS to reduce load times
  - Provide endpoints for gallery/explore page (NFT listings with filters)
  - Aggregate auction data and bidder lists from Base
  - Cross-chain data correlation (match payments on Base with NFTs on Story)
  - Optional: Proxy requests to Go relayer for status updates
- **Why Next.js?**: Direct integration with frontend, serverless functions, easy caching, TypeScript type safety

**Key Difference**:
- **Go Relayer = Write Operations** (execute blockchain transactions automatically)
- **Next.js API = Read Operations** (serve data to users, no transaction execution)

```
**Storage**:
  - IPFS/Pinata: Images and NFT metadata
    - Original images: 2000x2000px (1:1), PNG/JPG format, max 10MB, with optional transparency
    - Automatically generated optimized versions:
      - Thumbnail (gallery): 400x400px
      - Media (cards): 800x800px
      - Full (detail view): 2000x2000px original
    - Metadata: ERC-721 JSON standard with attributes/traits
- Database: Auxiliary information, cache and cross-chain tracking


Flujo correcto:
Fase 1: Admin prepara (ANTES de la subasta)
Admin Panel:
├── Sube SOLO la imagen a Pinata → ipfs://QmImageHash
└── Guarda este hash asociado al NFT ID
Fase 2: Subasta ocurre
Base Contract:
├── createAuction(nftId: 5, duration, tokens...)
├── Usuarios hacen bids (se guardan on-chain como eventos)
└── Auction termina → ganador definido
Fase 3: Backend genera metadata completo (DESPUÉS)
Backend/Relayer:
├── Detecta AuctionWon
├── Lee todos los bids del contrato
├── Crea metadata JSON completo:
   {
     "name": "Kukuxumusu #5",
     "image": "ipfs://QmImageHash", ← de Fase 1
     "description": "...",
     "attributes": [...],
     "auction_history": [todos los bids] ← de blockchain
   }
├── Sube este JSON a Pinata → ipfs://QmMetadataHash
└── Mintea NFT con esta URI completa
Entonces necesitas:
Admin panel: Solo sube imagen + datos básicos → guarda relación nftId → imageHash
Backend/Relayer: Genera metadata completo + sube a Pinata + mintea
¿Modifico el UploadNFTForm para que solo suba la imagen y datos básicos (sin generar metadata final)


#### Deployment
- **Frontend/Backend/Relayer**: AWS EC2 with Docker containers
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose for consistent environments
- **CI/CD**: Automated pipeline for container build and deploy
- **Payment Smart Contract**: Deployed and verified on Base mainnet
- **NFT Smart Contract**: Deployed and verified on Story Protocol mainnet
- **Relayer Service**: Persistent service with automatic retries to guarantee mints
- **Domain**: Custom domain configuration with SSL/TLS
- **Scalability**: Possibility to scale horizontally with multiple EC2 instances
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch for cross-chain event tracking and alerts

## 🔧 GO RELAYER - DETAILED TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

### Architecture Overview

The Go Relayer is a critical component that bridges Base (payments) and Story Protocol (NFT minting). It operates as a standalone service with the following responsibilities:

**Primary Functions:**
1. **Event Listener**: Monitor Base blockchain for payment/auction events
2. **Price Oracle**: Provide real-time token prices with cryptographic signatures
3. **Mint Executor**: Automatically mint NFTs on Story Protocol
4. **Transaction Queue**: Manage pending cross-chain operations

```

### REST API Endpoints

**Price Oracle Endpoints:**
```
GET  /api/price/:token        # Get current price for token (ETH/VTN/USDT)
POST /api/sign-bid            # Sign bid with USD value
     Request: { tokenAddress, amount, bidder, auctionId }
     Response: { valueInUSD, signature, timestamp }
```

**Monitoring Endpoints:**
```
GET  /health                  # Health check
GET  /api/queue               # View pending mint queue
GET  /api/tx/:hash            # Get cross-chain tx status
GET  /metrics                 # Prometheus metrics
```

**Admin Endpoints (authenticated):**
```
POST /admin/retry/:id         # Retry failed transaction
POST /admin/pause             # Pause relayer operations
POST /admin/resume            # Resume relayer operations
```

### Price Oracle Implementation

**Multi-Source Price Fetching:**
```go
type PriceSource interface {
    FetchPrice(tokenSymbol string) (float64, error)
}

// Sources:
1. CoinGecko API (primary for ETH, USDT)
2. QuickNode API (for VTN token)
3. Fallback to fixed prices if APIs unavailable
```

**Price Signature Generation:**
```go
// Message format for signing:
message = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
    tokenAddress,
    amount,
    valueInUSD,
    bidder,
    auctionId,
    timestamp
))

signature = sign(message, trustedSignerPrivateKey)
```

**Cache Strategy:**
- Redis or in-memory cache
- TTL: 5 minutes for volatile tokens (ETH, VTN)
- TTL: 30 minutes for stablecoins (USDT)
- Automatic invalidation on major price swings (>5%)

### Event Processing Flow

**1. Base Event Listener (Goroutine):**
```go
func ListenToBaseEvents() {
    // Subscribe to Payment contract events
    events := []string{"AuctionWon", "DirectPurchase", "PaymentReceived"}

    for event := range eventChannel {
        go ProcessPaymentEvent(event) // Parallel processing
    }
}
```

**2. Event Processing:**
```go
func ProcessPaymentEvent(event PaymentEvent) {
    // 1. Validate event
    // 2. Check idempotency (prevent double mint)
    // 3. Add to mint queue
    // 4. Trigger mint on Story Protocol
}
```

**3. Story Protocol Mint:**
```go
func MintNFT(nftId, winner, metadataURI) error {
    // 1. Generate metadata JSON
    // 2. Upload metadata to Pinata
    // 3. Call Story contract mint function
    // 4. Transfer NFT to winner
    // 5. Update database status
}
```
